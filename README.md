Binary Search Tree Project in Assembly Language:
The Binary Search Tree Project is implemented in Assembly Language using the Irvine32 library and Visual Studio as the development environment.

Overview:
The Binary Search Tree (BST) project aims to create a binary search tree data structure in Assembly Language. It provides operations for inserting nodes into the tree, searching for a specific value, and traversing the tree in different orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

Features:
Insertion: Insert nodes into the binary search tree while maintaining the BST property.
Search: Search for a specific value in the binary search tree.
Deletion: Delete a node from binary tree.
Traversal: Traverse the binary search tree in in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

Programming Language used:
Assembly Language
Irvine32 Library:
The Irvine32 library is a library of procedures for Assembly Language programming in Windows. It provides functions for input/output operations, string manipulation, and more, making it easier to develop Assembly Language programs for Windows platforms.

Tool Used:
Visual Studio is used as the development environment for this project. It provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with features such as syntax highlighting, code debugging, and project management, which facilitate the development of Assembly Language programs.

Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio.
Ensure that the Irvine32 library is properly configured in the project settings.
Build the project to generate the executable file.

Usage:
Run the compiled executable file to launch the Binary Search Tree program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations such as insertion, search, and traversal of the binary search tree.
